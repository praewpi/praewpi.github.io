We propose a Deep Q-learning (DQN) scheduler integrated into Kubernetes that consolidates workloads onto fewer active nodes to minimize cluster power consumption, outperforming baselines (Random, Round Robin, Best Fit, Default Kubernetes Scheduler), while revealing an inherent energy–performance tradeoff.",
